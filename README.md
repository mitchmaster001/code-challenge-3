README .
Every GitHub repository should have a README.md file. It's often the first thing someone new to your project sees and is frequently the only source of documentation. The READMEs we will write will have the extension,.md which stands for Markdown. Like HTML, Markdown is a language that uses annotations to format the display of text.
The README file should be located in the top level of the project directory. GitHub knows to look for a file named "README" and display the contents on the repo's viewing page.
It's worth taking the time to make your README look presentable because it will be the first thing anyone will see in your repositories. You want to make a solid first impression - if people see that you have a messy or incomplete README, they will assume that your code is also messy or incomplete. You want to make it as easy as possible for your users (such as potential employers) to check out your code. Writing a strong README is a good way to practice - and showcase - your empathy as a developer.
Check out the following examples of good READMEs:
WebApp
Links to an external site.
: description, live demo, screenshots, usage and collaboration instructions, technologies used, to do list, collaborators, license
PageRes
Links to an external site.
: logo, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, API documentation, links to related repos, live demo, collaborators, license
Node.JS Chat
Links to an external site.
: description, screenshot, live demo, features, setup instructions, usage instructions, license
As you can see from these examples, READMEs vary widely from one repository to the next, depending on the project needs. This is why it's important that your README is well-organized and easy to read. Moringa School recommends including as a minimum the following sections:
Application name
Names of contributors
Description of the project's purpose
Complete setup/installation instructions
License information with a copyright and date
Additional sections to consider:
Live demo
Instructions on running tests
Technologies used
Future features or to do list
Known bugs
Contact information
Support or contribution instructions
Below is a README sample template written in Markdown. Feel free to copy and paste the text below into a new file and replace the relevant parts in curly brackets with information about your project. It includes sections from above, but you can modify this in any way to suit your project's needs or to make your README look the way you want.
# {Application Name}
#### {Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}
#### By **{List of contributors}**
## Description
{This is a detailed description of your application, including its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know? Outline any issues that would impact use of your application. Share any workarounds that are in place. }
## Technologies Used
{Tell me about the languages and tools you used to create this app. Assume that I know you probably used HTML and CSS. If you did something really cool using only HTML, point that out.}
## Support and contact details
{Let people know what to do if they run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns.  Encourage them to contact you or make a contribution to the code.}
